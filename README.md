# ShinyWeather

This app will show the weather in a Shiny app in a friendly manner for children.
It will show temperature, wind, chances of rain.
Depending on the temperature, wind and rain it will show a picture of 
what can be done outside which can be refreshed to give several ideas.

It uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
